Two-Pointer Linked List Techniques

Many common singly linked list problems can be solved by iterating with two pointers.

Two Pointers Moving in Parallel

Complete the nth_last_node() function so that it returns the correct Node instance (or None if the linked_list is shorter than n elements). Do this without creating any additional new data structures (such as a list). You can assume that the linked list has no cycles.

You can use the generate_test_linked_list() function to test it yourself. It returns a linked list with values from 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 49 -> 50.
